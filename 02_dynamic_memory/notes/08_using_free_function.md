# üßπ Deallocating Memory Using the `free()` Function

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview

When you allocate memory dynamically using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`,  
that memory **must eventually be released** ‚Äî otherwise, it remains reserved and can cause **memory leaks**.

The function responsible for releasing that memory is `free()`.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Function Prototype

```c
void free(void *ptr);
````

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `ptr`     | `void *` | Pointer to the previously allocated memory block. |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works

* The `free()` function **returns** a block of memory to the **heap**.
* Once freed, the pointer still *holds the same address*, but that memory is no longer valid to access.
* The region may later be **reused** for another allocation.

Example:

```c
int *pi = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
*pi = 5;
free(pi);
```

After `free(pi);`,

* The memory at address `pi` is released.
* The variable `pi` still holds the address (a ‚Äúdangling pointer‚Äù).
* Accessing `*pi` after freeing is **undefined behavior**.

Before: pi ‚Üí [Heap: 500: value 5]
After : pi ‚Üí [Heap: 500: freed]  (pi still points to old address)
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Behavior with Special Cases

| Case                                    | Description                         |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `free(NULL)`                            | Does nothing (safe to call).        |
| `free(pointer_not_allocated_by_malloc)` | **Undefined behavior** ‚Äî may crash. |

Example of invalid usage:

```c
int num;
int *pi = &num;
free(pi);   // ‚ùå Invalid ‚Äî not heap memory
```

---

## üß† Important Rule

> Manage allocation and deallocation at the **same level** ‚Äî
> if memory is allocated in a function, it should be freed in that same function.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Avoiding Dangling Pointers

Even after freeing memory, a pointer still contains the old address.
Dereferencing it can crash the program.

To prevent this, **assign `NULL`** to the pointer immediately after freeing:

```c
int *pi = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
free(pi);
pi = NULL;
```

‚úÖ Now, `pi` is invalid but safe ‚Äî dereferencing it will fail immediately instead of accessing garbage.

```
Before: pi ‚Üí [500: 5]
After : pi = NULL
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Double Free Error

A **double free** happens when you attempt to release the same memory twice.
This usually leads to **runtime errors** or heap corruption.

Example 1 ‚Äî simple case:

```c
int *pi = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
free(pi);
free(pi);  // ‚ùå Runtime error ‚Äî double free
```

Example 2 ‚Äî two pointers referencing the same memory:

```c
int *p1 = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
int *p2 = p1;

free(p1);
free(p2);  // ‚ùå Same memory freed twice
```

---

## üß© Figure 2-10 ‚Äî Double Free Example

```
Before:
  p1 ‚Üí [500: 5]
  p2 ‚Üí [500: 5]

After:
  Memory freed, but p2 still points to 500 ‚Üí double free crash
```

üí° **When two pointers refer to the same memory**, this is known as **aliasing**.
Be very careful when freeing such memory.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ The Heap and System Memory

The heap‚Äôs space is managed by the operating system.
When you free memory using `free()`, the OS **does not always immediately reclaim it**.
Instead, the freed block becomes available for reuse **within the same program**.

So while your program‚Äôs memory usage may appear unchanged from the OS‚Äôs perspective,
the heap manager internally marks it as reusable.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Freeing Memory Upon Program Termination

When a program terminates normally, the **operating system** reclaims all its memory ‚Äî
including any blocks allocated dynamically.

That means forgetting to `free()` won‚Äôt cause leaks after program termination,
but it‚Äôs still considered **bad practice** in production code.

| Reason to Free Memory Before Exit | Explanation                                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Good habit / code quality         | Helps identify real leaks using analysis tools. |
| Long-running applications         | Prevents gradual memory exhaustion.             |
| Reuse within program              | Keeps heap clean and reduces fragmentation.     |

However, in small or short-lived programs, freeing every structure before exit may:

* Be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.
* Add complexity and risk of new bugs.
* Increase runtime slightly.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept                | Description                                         |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Releases dynamically allocated memory back to heap. |
| **Pointer after free** | Becomes invalid (dangling).                         |
| **Freeing NULL**       | Safe, does nothing.                                 |
| **Double Free**        | Dangerous ‚Äî can corrupt memory.                     |
| **Best Practice**      | Always set pointer to `NULL` after freeing.         |
| **Responsibility**     | Allocate and free at the same program level.        |

## üß≠ Best Practices

* `free()` only what was allocated with `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`.
* Always check for `NULL` before freeing.
* Immediately set pointer to `NULL` after freeing.
* Avoid freeing memory twice.
* Keep allocation/deallocation logic consistent (same scope or function).

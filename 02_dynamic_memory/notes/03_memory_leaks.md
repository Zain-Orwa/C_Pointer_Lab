# üß† Memory Leaks in C

---

## üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ What Is a Memory Leak?

A **memory leak** occurs when memory is allocated from the heap but never freed, even though it is no longer used.

In other words, the program ‚Äúforgets‚Äù about that memory ‚Äî so it stays reserved until the program ends.

### Common Causes:
- The **address** of the allocated memory is lost.  
- The **`free()`** function is never called.  
- The program keeps objects in heap memory longer than needed (hidden leaks).

---

## üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Memory Leaks Matter

When leaked, memory **cannot be reclaimed** or reused by the heap manager.  
Over time, this reduces available memory. In severe cases:
- The program runs out of memory (`malloc()` fails).
- The system slows down or crashes.

### Example:

```c
char *chunk;
while (1) {
    chunk = (char *) malloc(1000000); // 1 MB each iteration
    printf("Allocating\n");
}
````

üßæ **What happens:**

* Each loop allocates 1 MB.
* The previous address is overwritten before freeing it.
* The heap keeps growing until the system runs out of memory.

## üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Losing the Address

Sometimes the address of a previously allocated block is overwritten before `free()` is called.

### Example:

```c
int *pi = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
*pi = 5;

/* Lost previous allocation! */
pi = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
```

üí£ The first block is **lost** ‚Äî no pointer refers to it anymore.
Even if you call `free(pi)` later, it only frees the **second** allocation.

### üß≠ Memory Visualization

```text
Before second malloc()
Stack:
  pi ‚Üí 500
Heap:
  [500]: 5

After second malloc()
Stack:
  pi ‚Üí 600
Heap:
  [500]: 5 (lost)
  [600]: ?? (new allocation)
```

| State                    | pi Address | Heap Block       | Problem     |
| :----------------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| Before second `malloc()` | 500        | Holds `5`        | OK          |
| After second `malloc()`  | 600        | First block lost | Memory leak |

## üîπ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Example ‚Äî Losing Address with String Pointer

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    char *name = (char *) malloc(strlen("Susan") + 1);
    strcpy(name, "Susan");

    while (*name != '\0') {
        printf("%c", *name);
        name++; // shifts pointer forward
    }
}
```

üßæ **Problem:**
At the end of the loop, `name` no longer points to the start of the string.
It now points to the string‚Äôs **null terminator**, so the original address is lost ‚Äî you can‚Äôt `free(name)` anymore.

### üß≠ Memory Visualization

```text
Heap:
600 ‚Üí [S][u][s][a][n][\0]
Stack:
name ‚Üí 605  (now points at '\0')
```

| Step  | `name` Points To | Comment                                     |
| :---- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Start | `'S'`            | OK                                          |
| End   | `'\0'`           | Lost start address ‚Äî cannot `free()` safely |

## üîπ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hidden Memory Leaks

A **hidden leak** happens when:

* An object or structure remains allocated longer than needed.
* The programmer forgets to release its resources.

This doesn‚Äôt crash immediately but wastes memory quietly.

Example:
If you allocate memory inside a `struct` and only free the struct itself without freeing its inner pointers, those internal allocations remain leaked.

---

### Example Pattern

```c
struct person {
    char *name;
    int *scores;
};

struct person *p = malloc(sizeof(struct person));
p->name = malloc(50);
p->scores = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

free(p); // ‚ùå Wrong ‚Äî leaks p->name and p->scores
```

‚úÖ **Correct Sequence:**

```c
free(p->name);
free(p->scores);
free(p);
```

## üîπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary of Leak Types

| Leak Type        | Description                                                   | Example Cause                                   |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Lost Address** | The pointer is reassigned before freeing the original memory. | `p = malloc(...)` called twice without `free()` |
| **Never Freed**  | Allocated block not freed before program exits.               | Forgetting `free()` entirely                    |
| **Hidden Leak**  | Object stays in heap even when not needed.                    | Keeping unused data structures                  |
| **Nested Leak**  | Structure freed without freeing its dynamic members.          | Freeing outer struct only                       |

## üîπ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Prevention Strategies

| Strategy                                     | Description                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Always call `free()`**                  | Pair every allocation with a proper release.                 |
| **2. Set pointers to `NULL` after freeing.** | Prevents dangling references.                                |
| **3. Use memory analysis tools.**            | Tools like *Valgrind*, *AddressSanitizer* help detect leaks. |
| **4. Track ownership clearly.**              | Decide which function is responsible for freeing memory.     |
| **5. Avoid unnecessary reallocations.**      | Reuse allocated memory where possible.                       |

## üí¨ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways

* Losing or forgetting a pointer ‚Üí memory leak.
* A pointer moved inside an allocated block ‚Üí cannot free safely.
* Free in reverse order of allocation when dealing with nested structures.
* Use tools and discipline to detect leaks early.
* Even small leaks add up ‚Äî avoid them from day one.

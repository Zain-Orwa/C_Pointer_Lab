# 🧩 Using `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` in C

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ Overview

`intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` are **integer types designed to safely store pointer addresses**.  
They are defined in `<stdint.h>` and are guaranteed to be **the same size as a pointer** on the system.

These types make it possible to:
- Convert pointers to integers safely
- Perform pointer arithmetic or hashing as integers
- Print, store, or compare pointer values in a portable way

---

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Type Definitions

| Type | Signedness | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `intptr_t` | Signed integer type | Used for general pointer-to-integer conversions |
| `uintptr_t` | Unsigned integer type | Used for non-negative address manipulation |

Example simplified internal definitions (from `<stdint.h>`):

```c
typedef long int           intptr_t;   // or int, depending on system
typedef unsigned long int  uintptr_t;  // unsigned version
````

## 🧩 3️⃣ Why Use Them?

Normally, pointers and integers have **different sizes** depending on your architecture:

| System | Pointer Width | `int` Width |                 Safe?                |
| :----- | :-----------: | :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| 32-bit |    4 bytes    |   4 bytes   |             ✅ Usually OK             |
| 64-bit |    8 bytes    |   4 bytes   | ❌ Risk of data loss if cast directly |

`intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` guarantee the integer is large enough to store **any valid pointer address**.

💡 **Rule:**

> Never cast a pointer directly to `int` or `unsigned int` — use `intptr_t` or `uintptr_t`.

## 🧮 4️⃣ Example — Safe Pointer Casting

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(void) {
    int num = 42;

    int *p = &num;
    intptr_t  ip  = (intptr_t)p;   // signed integer version
    uintptr_t uip = (uintptr_t)p;  // unsigned integer version

    printf("Pointer address: %p\n", (void*)p);
    printf("intptr_t value : %ld\n", (long)ip);
    printf("uintptr_t value: %lu\n", (unsigned long)uip);

    return 0;
}
```

### 🖥️ Example Output (64-bit system)

```
Pointer address: 0x7ffee3a4b8dc
intptr_t value : 140732694078940
uintptr_t value: 140732694078940
```

✅ Both integer types hold the same address value safely.

---

## ⚠️ 5️⃣ Invalid Usage Example

```c
int num;
intptr_t *pi = &num;     // ❌ Wrong — cannot point to intptr_t*
uintptr_t *pu = &num;    // ❌ Wrong — type mismatch
```

Compiler error:

```
error: invalid conversion from 'int*' to 'intptr_t*'
```

✅ Correct way:

```c
int num;
intptr_t  pi  = (intptr_t)&num;
uintptr_t pu  = (uintptr_t)&num;
```

Explanation:

* `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` store pointer *values* (as integers), not addresses of integers.
* Use them as integer variables, not pointer variables.

---

## 🧱 6️⃣ Safe Casting with Other Data Types

When working with different pointer types, always cast explicitly:

```c
char c;
uintptr_t pc = (uintptr_t)&c;  // ✅ valid
```

⚠️ If you try to assign `&c` directly to a `uintptr_t *`, you’ll get a **type mismatch**.

## 🧩 7️⃣ When and Why to Use Them

| Use Case                           | Example                       | Reason                     |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Storing pointer values numerically | `(uintptr_t)p`                | Platform-safe conversion   |
| Performing address arithmetic      | `(uintptr_t)p + 16`           | Integer-based manipulation |
| Debugging / Logging addresses      | `printf("%lu", (uintptr_t)p)` | Displays numeric form      |
| Writing portable low-level code    | Hardware / OS dev             | Compatible with 32/64-bit  |

---

## ⚠️ 8️⃣ Warnings and Caveats

* **Don’t use them for normal pointer arithmetic.** Use regular pointers instead.
* **Don’t assume they exist on non-standard compilers** — they are part of C99 and later.
* **Avoid narrowing conversions** (e.g., casting `intptr_t` to `int` on 64-bit).
* **Never cast pointers to small integer types** (like `short` or `int`) — data loss is guaranteed.

## 🧠 9️⃣ 64-bit vs 32-bit Example

| System | `sizeof(void*)` | `sizeof(intptr_t)` | `sizeof(uintptr_t)` |
| :----- | :-------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
| 32-bit |     4 bytes     |       4 bytes      |       4 bytes       |
| 64-bit |     8 bytes     |       8 bytes      |       8 bytes       |

✅ Both types match pointer size exactly — that’s their purpose.

## 🧩 🔟 Historical Note — Near, Far, and Huge Pointers

On **early Intel 16-bit systems (e.g., 8086, 80286)**,
memory was **segmented** into blocks of 64 KB.

| Type             | Memory Reach       | Speed   | Notes                          |
| :--------------- | :----------------- | :------ | :----------------------------- |
| **Near pointer** | ~64 KB             | Fast    | Addressed only current segment |
| **Far pointer**  | ~1 MB              | Slower  | Contained segment + offset     |
| **Huge pointer** | ~1 MB (normalized) | Slowest | Used highest possible segment  |

These were **non-standard compiler extensions**.
Modern 32/64-bit architectures use **flat virtual memory**, so all pointers are now uniform in size.

## 🧪 11️⃣ Live Demo — Integer Conversion and Restoration

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(void) {
    int num = 123;
    int *ptr = &num;

    uintptr_t raw = (uintptr_t)ptr;   // store address as integer
    int *restored = (int *)raw;       // cast back safely

    printf("Original pointer : %p\n", (void*)ptr);
    printf("Integer value    : %lu\n", (unsigned long)raw);
    printf("Restored pointer : %p\n", (void*)restored);
    printf("Restored value   : %d\n", *restored);

    return 0;
}
```

### 🖥️ Example Output

```
Original pointer : 0x7ffee3a4b8dc
Integer value    : 140732694078940
Restored pointer : 0x7ffee3a4b8dc
Restored value   : 123
```

✅ The pointer value is preserved through the integer conversion — safely and portably.

# 🧩 Pointer to `void` — The Universal Pointer in C

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ What Is a `void *` Pointer?

A **pointer to `void`** (written `void *`) is a **general-purpose pointer type**.  
It can hold the address of **any data type** — `int`, `float`, `char`, or even a struct.

```c
void *pv;  // pv can point to anything
````

Think of it as a **“generic container for addresses.”**

---

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Key Properties

1. 🧩 **Same representation as `char *`**

   * A `void *` has the same **memory layout and alignment** as a `char *`.
   * That’s because both are designed to hold *any address*, byte-wise.

2. 🚫 **Not directly comparable to other pointer types**

   * You can’t safely compare a `void *` to another typed pointer (e.g., `int *`).
   * However, **two `void *` pointers that both hold `NULL`** will always be equal.

---

## 🔄 3️⃣ Casting Between Pointer Types

Any typed pointer can be safely assigned to a `void *`, and later **cast back** to its original type without data loss.

### ✅ Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int num = 42;
    int *pi = &num;

    printf("Value of pi: %p\n", (void *)pi);

    void *pv = pi;      // assign int pointer to void pointer
    pi = (int *)pv;     // cast it back to int pointer

    printf("Value of pi: %p\n", (void *)pi);

    return 0;
}
```

### 🖥️ Output

```
Value of pi: 0x100
Value of pi: 0x100
```

✅ The address stays **identical** — because the pointer value itself never changes;
we only changed how the **compiler interprets** the data it points to.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ Why `void *` Exists

`void *` is C’s version of **polymorphism** — a way to make one function or structure handle **multiple data types**.

For example, in the C standard library:

* `malloc()` returns `void *` because you can store **any type** in the allocated block:

  ```c
  int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
  double *q = malloc(sizeof(double));
  ```
* Both assignments work because `malloc()`’s return type is `void *`.

---

## ⚠️ 5️⃣ Dangers of `void *`

A `void *` doesn’t know what type it points to.
That means the compiler **can’t check** if your casts make sense.

Example of unsafe behavior:

```c
int x = 5;
void *pv = &x;

// 🚫 Wrong cast
double *pd = (double *)pv;
printf("%lf\n", *pd);  // undefined behavior
```

Here you’re telling the compiler that the address of an `int` is actually a `double`.
That’s **wrong and dangerous** — it breaks memory interpretation.

| Concept                | Description                                    | Example           | Notes                           |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **`void *`**           | A generic pointer that can hold any address    | `void *p;`        | Must cast before dereferencing  |
| **Cast to `void *`**   | Convert any pointer to general form            | `pv = pi;`        | Safe and implicit               |
| **Cast from `void *`** | Restore original type                          | `pi = (int *)pv;` | Must be explicit                |
| **Equality rule**      | Two `void *` are equal only if both are `NULL` | `(pv1 == pv2)`    | Otherwise undefined             |
| **Memory alignment**   | Same as `char *`                               | —                 | Ensures universal compatibility |

## 💡 7️⃣ Real-World Uses

| Use Case                  | Example                                          |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic memory (`malloc`) | Returns `void *` to be cast by user              |
| Generic data structures   | `void *data;` in linked lists or trees           |
| Function arguments        | Passing unknown data types to callback functions |

## ⚠️ 8️⃣ Important Warnings

> ❗ A `void *` cannot be **dereferenced** directly.
> You must **cast it back** to the correct type first.

Example:

```c
void *pv;
int x = 10;

pv = &x;          // ✅ assign address
*pv = 20;         // ❌ invalid: pv has no known type
*((int *)pv) = 20; // ✅ correct: cast before dereference
```

---

## 🧠 9️⃣ Rule of Thumb

> * Use `void *` for **generic storage** or **type-agnostic parameters**.
> * Always **cast back** before dereferencing.
> * Never use it for **function pointers** — it’s for **data pointers only**.
> * If you see `malloc()`, `free()`, or a generic data structure → expect `void *`.

║        Pointer Type Casting Example           ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[int num] = 42

[void *pv] ---> [num]   (generic container)
[int *pi] ---> [num]    (cast back safely)

All arrows point to the same memory address.
```

💬 **In short:**

> A `void *` is a universal pointer — flexible, powerful, and dangerous if abused.
> Always cast responsibly, and never dereference it directly.

# üß© Understanding C Memory Models

## üß† What‚Äôs a ‚ÄúMemory Model‚Äù?

A **memory model** defines how much memory (in bits) the compiler assigns to basic C data types like `int`, `long`, and pointers ‚Äî depending on your system (32-bit, 64-bit, or specific OS rules).

So basically:

> It‚Äôs the ‚Äúmeasurement system‚Äù your machine uses for data types.

Different systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) may follow **different models**, even if both are ‚Äú64-bit.‚Äù

## üß± The Code Pattern ‚Äî `I In L Ln LL LLn P Pn`

This pattern is a shorthand to describe the sizes of basic types in bits.
Let‚Äôs break it down:

| Symbol  | Meaning                   | Example                            |
| :------ | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| **I**   | `int`                     | I = 32 means `int` is 32 bits      |
| **In**  | ‚Äún‚Äù = bit size for `int`  | e.g., In = 64 ‚Üí `int` is 64 bits   |
| **L**   | `long`                    | L = 32 means `long` is 32 bits     |
| **Ln**  | ‚Äún‚Äù = bit size for `long` | e.g., Ln = 64 ‚Üí `long` is 64 bits  |
| **LL**  | `long long`               | LL = 64 means 64 bits              |
| **LLn** | optional explicit size    | e.g., LLn = 128                    |
| **P**   | `pointer`                 | P = 32 or 64 depending on system   |
| **Pn**  | explicit pointer size     | e.g., Pn = 64 means 64-bit pointer |

üëâ These letters show **which types** differ between models and **what bit sizes** they use.

## üß© Common Models Explained

| Model     | Meaning                               | Used By                 | Description                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **LP64**  | `Long` and `Pointer` are 64 bits      | Linux / macOS           | Most Unix-like 64-bit systems |
| **ILP64** | `Int`, `Long`, `Pointer` are 64 bits  | Some HPC systems        | Used on some supercomputers   |
| **LLP64** | `Long Long` and `Pointer` are 64 bits | Windows 64-bit          | Microsoft‚Äôs 64-bit model      |
| **ILP32** | `Int`, `Long`, `Pointer` are 32 bits  | 32-bit Linux / Windows  | Classic 32-bit systems        |
| **LP32**  | `Long` and `Pointer` are 32 bits      | Very old 16-bit systems | Rare legacy model             |

## üìè Type Sizes in Each Model

| C Data Type   | LP64 | ILP64 | LLP64 | ILP32 | LP32 |
| :------------ | :--- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :--- |
| **char**      | 8    | 8     | 8     | 8     | 8    |
| **short**     | 16   | 16    | 16    | 16    | 16   |
| **int**       | 32   | 64    | 32    | 32    | 16   |
| **long**      | 64   | 64    | 32    | 32    | 32   |
| **long long** | 64   | 64    | 64    | 64    | 64   |
| **pointer**   | 64   | 64    | 64    | 32    | 32   |

## üíª Real Example: Pointer and Long Sizes

### Example 1 ‚Äî Linux/macOS (LP64)

```c
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(long));    // 8 bytes
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(void*));   // 8 bytes
```

Both are 8 bytes ‚Üí LP64 model.

### Example 2 ‚Äî Windows (LLP64)

```c
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(long));    // 4 bytes
printf("%zu\n", sizeof(void*));   // 8 bytes
```

Different sizes ‚Üí LLP64 model.

So even though both are *64-bit systems*, they use **different memory models**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why It Matters

If you write portable code, **never assume** an `int` or `long` has a specific size.
Instead, use fixed-width integer types from `<stdint.h>`:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

int32_t  i;   // always 32 bits
int64_t  j;   // always 64 bits
uintptr_t p;  // stores pointer as integer safely
```

These types stay consistent across compilers and platforms.

| **Pointer size**          | Matches system address width (32 or 64 bits)  |
| **Use fixed-width types** | For portable, consistent behavior             |

## üß† Mental Analogy

Think of these models like **different rulers**:

| Model | Analogy                                          |
| :---- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| LP64  | Metric ruler (cm) ‚Äî standard across Unix systems |
| LLP64 | Imperial ruler (inches) ‚Äî Windows has its own    |
| ILP32 | Shorter ruler ‚Äî 32-bit era                       |
| ILP64 | Giant ruler ‚Äî used by special supercomputers     |

Different rulers, same concept: each measures, but the **units differ**.
